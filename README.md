- I chose `create-react-app` as I'm familiar with it it is easy-to-setup and
  always have been my go-to for rapid prototyping of React apps
- I usedinstalled `octokit` instead of `@octokit/core` which was recommended
  in the assessment exactly for no reason!
- I did not use prettier (or any other formatter) as I was the only developer on this project and project is a short-term develop project as well
