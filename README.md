- I chose `create-react-app` as I'm familiar with it it is easy-to-setup and
  always have been my go-to for rapid prototyping of React apps
- I usedinstalled `octokit` instead of `@octokit/core` which was recommended in
  the assessment exactly for no reason!
- I did not use prettier (or any other formatter) as I was the only developer on
  his project and project is a short-term develop project as well
- I chose to use styled-components as I'm familiar with it and I like the
  approach
- I chose not to use any UI/CSS library as I believe pure CSS is a good choice
  for such a minimal project (I just ignored browser-compatability issues that
  might rise due to this choice)
